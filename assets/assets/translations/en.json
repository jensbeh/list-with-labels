  "meaning_of_labels_text": "Certain categories are specified for the articles, each of which provides information about the argumentative orientation of the article. These are called \"Industrie\", \"Markt\", \"Grün\" oder \"Staat\". The \"Industrie\" label refers to a perspective that aligns arguments according to their orientation towards planning and standardizability. Measurable data and statistics play a relevant role. The \"Markt\" label, on the other hand, refers to a line of argument based on a common good perspective of demand orientation and free exchange. Behind the label \"Staat\" lies a perspective that marks the arguments in the articles with regard to their orientation towards fairness, participation and equality. And, last but not least, the label \"Grün\" refers to an argument that advocates environmental awareness and sustainability.\nIn addition, these categories can be annotated with a + or - to differentiate whether a positive or negative reference is made to an argumentative perspective, i.e. whether it is criticized or supported. Without a suffix, the reference is neutral.  It is also possible that several different positions are taken up in one article.",
